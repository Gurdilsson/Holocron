<h1>Star Wars Rpg Application</h1>

Hey ! Here is a little one-week-project in React made for our FantasyFlightGames Star Wars rpg campain. It was the occasion for me to have fun with Css, html and React. 

Some improvements I will probably add in a distant future, in a galaxy far far away :
_ Make it work in every navigator
_ Fix parallax issues depending on the screen size (no idea on how to do that tho)
_ Add some piew piew laser with the millenium condor
_ Fix the scrolling issues in the holocron window

/!\ This app only works for the moment on mobile, or with the mobile view in the navigator. /!\ 

App Status: 
[![Deploy ðŸš€](https://github.com/Gurdilsson/Holocron/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Gurdilsson/Holocron/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
